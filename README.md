A basic network sniffer using Python and Scapy
# Network Sniffer in Python 🕵️‍♂️

This is a basic network sniffer built using Python and the Scapy library.  
It captures live network packets and displays:

- Source and Destination IPs
- Protocol type (TCP/UDP)
- Raw packet payload

## How to Run

1. Install Scapy:
   pip install scapy

2. Run the script as administrator:
   python sniffer.py

> Note: On Windows, install Npcap from https://npcap.com for packet capturing to work.
